By using the CodeElo evaluation scaffold, I commit to strictly adhering to the Codeforces Terms and Conditions (https://codeforces.com/terms) and the Codeforces Rule Restricting the Use of AI (https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133941), ensuring it does not impact the access of real users. I understand that the CodeElo is intended for academic research purposes only and will not be used for any commercial purposes. I pledge not to overuse the CodeElo by making concurrent requests or in any other way that could put unnecessary strain on the Codeforces servers.
